Journal website 

Description:
Create a website where people can log in and write an entry of a journal or small notes. Stores the text, time and user. 


Courses included: 
- Clientside: making the website for it
Bonus to me: would be to include some JS as im not fully comfortale with it but would like to be better in it.
- Database: creating the logins, and storing the entries so people can log in and read them again or (possibly delete them) 
- Server part: PHP


What to make it a success: 
- I need an actual page that works with databases. Since Githubs page is only clientside it cannot store things. 
- I need to read up on database and how to work with it since i missed that time in school. 


Monday: 
- Finish up overview of idea. 
- Read up on database.
- Start making website layout.
